    <h3>What distinguishes normal HTML elements from semantic HTML elements?</h3>
    <p>
        Semantic HTML elements provide more meaning to both the browser and the developer by conveying the purpose or structure of the content they wrap. For example, instead of just using a &lt;div&gt; to create a generic container, you might use a &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, or &lt;footer&gt; element to provide clearer structure and semantics to your document. This not only improves accessibility but also helps search engines better understand the content.
    </p>

    <h3> Explain the disparity between closing tags and self-closing tags in HTML.</h3>
    <p>
        Closing tags are used to mark the end of an HTML element, while self-closing tags are used to represent elements that don't have any content within them and therefore don't require a separate closing tag. For example, &lt;img&gt; is a self-closing tag because it doesn't contain any content; it simply inserts an image into the document. On the other hand, &lt;p&gt; is a tag that requires both an opening and a closing tag because it contains text or other elements between them.
    </p>

    <h3> What distinguishes inline elements from block elements in HTML?</h3>
    <p>Inline elements are those that don't start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. Examples include &lt;span&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, and  &lt;strong&gt;. Block elements, however, start on a new line and take up the full width available, pushing subsequent content onto a new line. Examples of block elements include &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, and &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
